`fp-ts-representable` is an implementation of [Representable Functors](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/representable-functors-3.2.0.2/docs/Data-Functor-Representable.html) in the `fp-ts` ecosystem, specifically with an eye toward their use in memoizing the `Store` comonad (such as used [in Chris Penner's post about the Game of Life](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/conways-game-of-life))
